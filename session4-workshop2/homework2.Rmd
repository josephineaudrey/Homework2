# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```


```{r}
glimpse(weather)
```



```{r tidyweather}
weather_select <- weather %>% 
  select(Year:Dec)

tidyweather <- weather_select %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "Month",
    values_to = "delta",
    cols = -Year
  )
tidyweather

```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

tidyweather_plot <- ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

tidyweather_plot

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

tidyweather_plot +
  facet_wrap(~month)

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values
  filter(na.rm = TRUE)

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_line(method = loess) +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}

library(infer)

average_annual_anomaly

comparison_filter <- drop_na(average_annual_anomaly) %>%
  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(Year > 2011)
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
comparison_formula_ci <- comparison_filter %>% 
  
  summarize(mean = mean(annual_average_delta), sd = sd(annual_average_delta), n = n()) %>%

  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  mutate(se = sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  mutate(lower_95 = mean - 2*se, upper_95 = mean + 2*se)

# print out formula_CI
comparison_formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
bootstrap_comparison <- comparison_filter %>% 
specify(response = annual_average_delta) %>% 
generate(reps = 1000) %>% 
calculate(stat = "mean")

comparison_ci <-bootstrap_comparison %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

comparison_ci

distribution <- bootstrap_comparison %>% 
  visualise() + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = comparison_ci )

distribution

  
```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

We are 95% confident that the average annual temperature deviation since 2011 is between 0.886 and 1.13. 

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.



```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r}
gss_snap_insta <- gss %>%
  # create the new variable for snap_insta
  mutate(snap_insta = case_when(
    snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes", 
    snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No" ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_)) 
  
# calculate the proportion
gss_prop <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  filter(!is.na(snap_insta)) %>% 
  group_by(snap_insta) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = count/sum(count)) 

gss_prop

# percentile_ci
snap_insta_formula_ci <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  # using the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(p_hat = prop(snap_insta == "Yes"),
            count = n(),
            se = sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical*se,
            lower_95 = p_hat - margin_of_error,
            upper_95 = p_hat + margin_of_error)

snap_insta_formula_ci

# additional plot for practice -> check the way that he did it in a previous example ?
histogram_si <- ggplot(snap_insta_formula_ci,  
       aes(x = sex,
           y = p_hat,
           colour = sex)) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95,
                     ymax = upper_95),
                     width = 0.05,
                     size  = 0.5) +

## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

```{r}
# turn degree from a character variable into a factor variable 
gss_factor <- gss %>%
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, order = TRUE, levels = c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate")))

# create the new variable bachelor_graduate and assign values based on criteria below:
gss_degree <- gss_factor %>%
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree %in% c("Bachelor","Master") ~ "Yes", 
    degree %in% c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college") ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ "NA"
    )) 

# filter out NAs and filter for bachelor and graduates
gss_bachelor <- gss_degree %>%
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes")


# calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` using twitter -> check error -> actually use " formula for difference in proportion"
gss_twitter_prop <- gss_bachelor %>%
  group_by(twitter) %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop_t = n/sum(n))
  

gss_twitter_prop

# construct CI for `bachelor_graduate` (not) using twitter (but with the NAs in the 100 % )
twitter_formula_ci <- gss_twitter_prop %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>%
   # use the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(twitter = twitter,
            p_hat_t = prop_t,
            # se for difference in proportions is sqrt(((p(1-p))/n) + ((p(1-p))/n))
            se_t = sqrt((p_hat_t *(1-p_hat_t))/n),
            count_t = n,
            t_critical_t = qt(0.975, count_t-1),
            margin_of_error_t = t_critical_t*se_t,
            lower_95_t = p_hat_t - margin_of_error_t,
            upper_95_t = p_hat_t + margin_of_error_t)

twitter_formula_ci
  
# check if Confidence Intervals overlap
histogram_t <- ggplot(twitter_formula_ci,  
       aes(x = twitter,
           y = p_hat_t,
           colour = twitter)) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95_t,
                     ymax = upper_95_t),
                     width = 0.05,
                     size  = 0.5) +

   theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
   NULL

## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.

2. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical among of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?

Answer: The median is a better measure than the mean for the typical amount of time Americans spend on email weekly since the mean is more sensitive to outliers than the median.

3. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.

Answer: The confidence interval and the mean are quite high because, as mentioned above, the mean is very sensitive to the  outlier in the data set. Thus, the values are higher than one might probably expect.

4. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

Answer: A 99% confidence interval would be wider than a 95% confidence interval since you have to be more confident that the true value (in the case email minutes) falls within the interval we will need to allow more potential values within the interval. The confidence level most commonly adopted is 95%.

```{r}
# create new variable email
gss_email <- gss %>% 
  filter(emailmin != "NA", emailhr != "NA") %>%
  mutate(emailmin = as.numeric(emailmin), emailhr = as.numeric(emailhr)) %>%

# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)

```

```{r trump_margins, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
net_approval_plot <- approval_polllist %>%
  filter(subgroup == "Voters") %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(enddate),
         year = year(date),
         week = week(date
        )) %>%

            count = n(),
            #get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            se_net_approval = sd_net_approval / sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_net_approval,
            net_approval_low = avg_net_approval - margin_of_error,
            net_approval_high = avg_net_approval + margin_of_error) %>%

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

>Answer

- The confidence interval for 'week 15' is [-9.93, -6.197], and for 'week 34' it is a wider [-12.26, -7.553], indicating that the deviation of Trump's polls became larger from April to August. This may be related to the mixed reviews he received in the handling of domestic issues, such as COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter.

library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful

```{r}
complete_data_filtered <- complete_data %>% drop_na()
ggplot(complete_data_filtered) +
geom_point(aes(
  x=estimated_hiv, 
  y=life_expec,
  colour = region
)) +
geom_smooth(aes(x=estimated_hiv, y=life_expec), se = FALSE)+
NULL

ggplot(complete_data_filtered) +
geom_point(aes(
  x=estimated_hiv, 
  y=life_expec,
)) +
geom_smooth(aes(x=estimated_hiv, y=life_expec), se = FALSE)+
facet_wrap(~region, scales = "free")+
NULL

```

Answer:
In general, HIV prevelance seems to have a negative relationship with life expectancy. If we look at the relationship by region, the negative correlation is most obvious in Latin America and Carribean and Sub-Saharan Africa, while in the other 4 regions HIV prevelance do not have a clear linear relationship with life expectancy.


2. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful

```{r}
ggplot(complete_data_filtered) +
geom_point(aes(
  x = female_fertility, 
  y = gdpPercap
)) +
geom_smooth(aes(
  x = female_fertility, 
  y = gdpPercap)) +
facet_wrap(~region, scales = "free") +
NULL
```
In general, fertality is positively related to GDP per capita. This positive relationship is most obvious in Latin America and Carribean and Middle East & North Africa.


3. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.

```{r}
missing_HIV_regions <- complete_data %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarise(missing_HIV_data = count(is.na(estimated_hiv))) %>% 
  filter(region != "NA")

missing_HIV_regions %>% 
ggplot(aes(
  x = reorder(region, missing_HIV_data),
  y = missing_HIV_data
)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  NULL
  

```
Answer: 
Sub-Saharan Africa has the most missing HIV data. Europe & Central Asia has the second most missing HIV data. 


4. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.

```{r}

mortality <- complete_data %>%
  select(1,2,10,18)%>%
  drop_na() 

delta <- mortality %>%
  group_by(country) %>% 
  filter(year == min(year) | year == max(year))

pivot_wider_delta <- delta %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year,
              values_from = mortality_rate) %>% 
  mutate(delta_mort_rate = `2011` - `1979`)


top_5_mort_change <- pivot_wider_delta %>% 
  select(country, delta_mort_rate) %>% 
  arrange(desc(delta_mort_rate)) %>% 
  head(n=5)

bottom_5_mort_change <- pivot_wider_delta %>% 
  select(country, delta_mort_rate) %>% 
  filter(country != "Serbia") %>% 
  arrange(desc(delta_mort_rate)) %>% 
  tail(n=5)

top_5_plot <- top_5_mort_change %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = reorder(country,desc(delta_mort_rate)),
    y = delta_mort_rate
  )) +
  geom_col()

bottom_5_plot <- bottom_5_mort_change %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = reorder(country,desc(delta_mort_rate)),
    y = delta_mort_rate
  )) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 5 countries mortality increase"
  )

bottom_5_plot
top_5_plot
  
```

# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data.

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

Answer: There are a lot less bike rentals in May and June compared to previous years and there is not a spike as in previous years. This can probably be explained be the Corona virus and lockdown where people used less bikes because more people were staying at home and e.g. working from home.

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r,fig.width=15}

library(lubridate)

bike_1<-bike%>%mutate(date=ymd(day),
              month=month(day,label=TRUE),
              year=year(date))%>%select(bikes_hired:month)

bike_2<-bike_1%>%
  filter(year>=2015)%>%
  group_by(year,month)%>%
  summarise(avg_bikes_hired=mean(bikes_hired))%>%
  group_by(month)%>%
  mutate(all_years_month_avg=mean(avg_bikes_hired))

bike_1
bike_2

ggplot(bike_2, aes(x=month,group=1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_bikes_hired), color = "darkred") + 
  geom_line(aes(y = all_years_month_avg), color="darkblue")+
facet_wrap(~year) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(
    x = month,
    ymin = avg_bikes_hired,
    ymax = pmax(avg_bikes_hired,all_years_month_avg)),
              alpha = 0.5,
              fill="red") +
  theme_bw() + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(
    x = month,
    ymin = pmin(avg_bikes_hired,all_years_month_avg),
    ymax = avg_bikes_hired),

      subtitle = " Change from monthly average shown in blue \n and calculated from 2015-2019",
      caption = "Source:TfL, London Data Store") +
  NULL

```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%",fig.width=25}

bikes_weekly_all_years<-bike%>%
filter(year >= 2015) %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  mutate(avg_week_over_all_years = mean(bikes_hired)) %>%
  group_by(year,week) %>%
  mutate(avg_week_single_year = mean(bikes_hired)) %>%
  mutate(pct_change = ((avg_week_single_year-avg_week_over_all_years)/avg_week_over_all_years)*100)

bikes_weekly_all_years


ggplot() +
 geom_ribbon(data = bikes_weekly_all_years[bikes_weekly_all_years$pct_change >= 0, ], 
             aes(
               x = week, 
               ymin = 0, 
               ymax = pct_change),
             alpha=0.5, fill="green") +
  geom_ribbon(
    data = bikes_weekly_all_years[bikes_weekly_all_years$pct_change < 0, ], 
    aes(
      x = week, 
      ymin = pct_change, 
      ymax = 0),
      alpha=0.5, 
      fill="red") +
 geom_line(
   data = bikes_weekly_all_years, 
   aes(
     x = week, 
     y = pct_change
     ))+
  facet_wrap(~year)


```


For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.
```{r}
glimpse(weather)
```

    cols = -Year
  )
tidyweather

```{r tidyweather}
weather_select <- weather %>% 
  select(Year:Dec)

tidyweather <- weather_select %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "Month",
    values_to = "delta",


```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

tidyweather_plot <- ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

tidyweather_plot +
  facet_wrap(~month)

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values
  filter(na.rm = TRUE)

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_line(method = loess) +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}
library(infer)
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta)
  specify(response = delta) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type ="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") #%>% 
   #%>% 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  #summarise(
    #mean = mean(delta),
    #SD = sd(delta),
    #count = n()
 # )

  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  
#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
formula_ci %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
  
```

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.

                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r}
gss_snap_insta <- gss %>%
  # create the new variable for snap_insta
  mutate(snap_insta = case_when(
    snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes", 
    snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No" ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_)) 
  
# calculate the proportion
gss_prop <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  filter(!is.na(snap_insta)) %>% 
  group_by(snap_insta) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = count/sum(count)) 

gss_prop

# percentile_ci
snap_insta_formula_ci <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  # using the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(p_hat = prop(snap_insta == "Yes"),
            count = n(),
            se = sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical*se,
            lower_95 = p_hat - margin_of_error,
            upper_95 = p_hat + margin_of_error)

snap_insta_formula_ci

# additional plot for practice -> check the way that he did it in a previous example ?
histogram_si <- ggplot(snap_insta_formula_ci,  
       aes(x = sex,
           y = p_hat,
           colour = sex)) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95,
                     ymax = upper_95),
                     width = 0.05,
                     size  = 0.5) +
   geom_point(shape = 15,
              size  = 4) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1)) +
   theme_bw() +
   theme(axis.title   = element_text(face  = "bold")) +
   labs(x = "Gender",
     y = "",
   title = "Women are more likely than men to use Snapchat or Instagram in 2016") +
   theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
   NULL

histogram_si


```


## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascending order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

```{r}

# turn degree from a character variable into a factor variable 
gss_factor <- gss %>%
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, order = TRUE, levels = c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate")))

# create the new variable bachelor_graduate and assign values based on criteria below:
gss_degree <- gss_factor %>%
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree %in% c("Bachelor","Master") ~ "Yes", 
    degree %in% c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college") ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ "NA"
    )) 

# filter out NAs and filter for bachelor and graduates
gss_bachelor <- gss_degree %>%
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes")


# calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` using twitter -> check error -> actually use " formula for difference in proportion"
gss_twitter_prop <- gss_bachelor %>%
  group_by(twitter) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop_t = n/sum(n)) %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA")

gss_twitter_prop

# construct CI for `bachelor_graduate` (not) using twitter (but with the NAs in the 100 % )
twitter_formula_ci <- gss_twitter_prop %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>%
   # use the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(twitter = twitter,
            p_hat_t = prop_t,
            # se for difference in proportions is sqrt(((p(1-p))/n) + ((p(1-p))/n))
            se_t = sqrt(sum((p_hat_t *(1-p_hat_t))/n)),
            count_t = n,
            t_critical_t = qt(0.975, count_t-1),
            margin_of_error_t = t_critical_t*se_t,
            lower_95_t = p_hat_t - margin_of_error_t,
            upper_95_t = p_hat_t + margin_of_error_t)

twitter_formula_ci
  
# check if Confidence Intervals overlap
histogram_t <- ggplot(twitter_formula_ci,  
       aes(x = twitter,
           y = p_hat_t,
           colour = twitter)) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95_t,
                     ymax = upper_95_t),
                     width = 0.05,
                     size  = 0.5) +
   geom_point(shape = 15,
              size  = 4) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1)) +
   theme_bw() +
   theme(axis.title   = element_text(face  = "bold")) +
   labs(x = "Twitter usage",
        y = "",
   title = "Twitter usage among people with a bachelor or graduate degree in 2016") +
   theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
   NULL

histogram_t


```


## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

```{r}
# create new variable email
gss_email <- gss %>% 
  filter(emailmin != "NA", emailhr != "NA") %>%
  mutate(emailmin = as.numeric(emailmin), emailhr = as.numeric(emailhr)) %>%
  mutate(email = emailhr*60 + emailmin)

# visualise the distribution -> still add legends !!
plot_email <- ggplot(gss_email, 
  aes(x = email)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(email, na.rm = T)),   # Ignore NA values for mean
               color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(email, na.rm = T)),   # Ignore NA values for mean
               color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Right-skewed distribution of time spent on emails by US adults",
       x = "Minutes spent on emails per week",
       y = " ")+
  NULL

plot_email

# calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean
boot_email <- gss_email %>% 
  specify(response = email) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") 
  
boot_email

# 95% CI and humanize units
percentile_ci <- boot_email %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile") 

percentile_ci

# still humanize units & add legend

```
### Comparison to a 99% confidence interval
A 99% confidence interval would be wider than a 95% confidence interval since you have to be more confident that the true value (in the case email minutes) falls within the interval we will need to allow more potential values within the interval. The confidence level most commonly adopted is 95%.

# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.



You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.


# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful
1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful
1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.
1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.
1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?


# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()


```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)
```


Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!


# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.

# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.
```{r}
glimpse(weather)
```

    cols = -Year
  )
tidyweather

```{r tidyweather}
weather_select <- weather %>% 
  select(Year:Dec)

tidyweather <- weather_select %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "Month",
    values_to = "delta",


```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

tidyweather_plot <- ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`.

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values
  filter(na.rm = TRUE)

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_line(method = loess) +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}
library(infer)
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta)
  specify(response = delta) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type ="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") #%>% 
   #%>% 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  #summarise(
    #mean = mean(delta),
    #SD = sd(delta),
    #count = n()
 # )

  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  
#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
formula_ci %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
  
```

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r}
# I'm working on this - Josi
gss %>% 
  mutate(snap_insta = case_when(
    snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes",
    snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No" ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ "NA"
  ))


```


## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascending order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

```{r}

gss %>% 
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree == "Bachelor" | degree == "Graduate" ~ "Yes",
    degree == "NA" ~ "NA",
    TRUE ~ "No"
)) %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes") %>% 
  select(twitter)


```


## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

```{r}
as.numeric(gss$emailhr)

```

# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.



You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r trump_margins}
net_approval_plot <- approval_polllist %>%
  filter(subgroup == "Voters") %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(enddate),
         year = year(date),
         week = week(date)) %>%
  group_by(year, week) %>%
  summarise(avg_net_approval = mean(adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove),
            sd_net_approval = sd(adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove),
            count = n(),
            #get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            se_net_approval = sd_net_approval / sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_net_approval,
            net_approval_low = avg_net_approval - margin_of_error,
            net_approval_high = avg_net_approval + margin_of_error) %>%
  ggplot(aes(week, avg_net_approval)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = net_approval_low, ymax = net_approval_high), alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), color = "orange") +
  labs(
    title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve - disapprove) for Donald Trump",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
    x = "week of the year",
    y = "Average Net Apporval (%)"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~year)

net_approval_plot
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

>Answer

- The confidence interval for 'week 15' is [-9.93, -6.197], and for 'week 34' it is a wider [-12.26, -7.553], indicating that the deviation of Trump's polls became larger from April to August. This may be ralated to the mixed reviews he received in the handling of domestic issues, such as COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter.

# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful
1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful
1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.
1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.
1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?


# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()




```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)

glimpse(covid_data)

options(scipen=999)

covid_co_morbidities <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(medcond_yn == "Yes" | medcond_yn == "No",
         sex == "Male" | sex == "Female", # filter out other, unknown and missing. Other is always zero.
         age_group != "Unknown",
         age_group != "NA"
         ) %>% 
  group_by(medcond_yn, age_group, sex) %>% 
  summarise(death_rate = count(death_yn == "Yes")/n())

covid_co_morbidities %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = age_group,
    y = death_rate,
    fill=sex,
    fill = medcond_yn
  )) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.7, position=position_dodge(width=0.8)) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ medcond_yn)

  

```


Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!


# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r,fig.width=15}

library(lubridate)

bike_1<-bike%>%mutate(date=ymd(day),
              month=month(day,label=TRUE),
              year=year(date))%>%select(bikes_hired:month)

bike_2<-bike_1%>%
  filter(year>=2015)%>%
  group_by(year,month)%>%
  summarise(avg_bikes_hired=mean(bikes_hired))%>%
  group_by(month)%>%
  mutate(all_years_month_avg=mean(avg_bikes_hired))

bike_1
bike_2

ggplot(bike_2, aes(x=month,group=1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_bikes_hired), color = "darkred") + 
  geom_line(aes(y = all_years_month_avg), color="darkblue")+
facet_wrap(~year) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x=month,ymin=avg_bikes_hired,ymax=pmax(avg_bikes_hired,all_years_month_avg)),alpha=0.5,fill="red") +theme_bw() + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(x=month,ymin=pmin(avg_bikes_hired,all_years_month_avg),ymax=avg_bikes_hired),alpha=0.3,fill="green")+ylab("Bikes Hired")+ 
  xlab(" ") +
  labs(title = " Monthly Changes in TFL Bike Rental",subtitle = " Change from monthly average shown in blue \n and calculated from 2015-2019",caption = "Source:TfL, London Data Store")

```


The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.

# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.
```{r}
glimpse(weather)
```



```{r tidyweather}
weather_select <- weather %>% 
  select(Year:Dec)

tidyweather <- weather_select %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "Month",
    values_to = "delta",
    cols = -Year
  )
tidyweather

```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

tidyweather_plot <- ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

tidyweather_plot +
  facet_wrap(~month)

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values
  filter(na.rm = TRUE)

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_line(method = loess) +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}

library(infer)

average_annual_anomaly

comparison_filter <- drop_na(average_annual_anomaly) %>%
  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(Year > 2011)
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
comparison_formula_ci <- comparison_filter %>% 
  
  summarize(mean = mean(annual_average_delta), sd = sd(annual_average_delta), n = n()) %>%

  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  mutate(se = sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  mutate(lower_95 = mean - 2*se, upper_95 = mean + 2*se)

#print out formula_CI
comparison_formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
bootstrap_comparison <- comparison_filter %>% 
specify(response = annual_average_delta) %>% 
generate(reps = 1000) %>% 
calculate(stat = "mean")

comparison_ci <-bootstrap_comparison %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

comparison_ci

distribution <- bootstrap_comparison %>% 
  visualise() + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = comparison_ci )

distribution

  
```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

We are 95% confident that the average annual temperature deviation since 2011 is between 0.886 and 1.13. 

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r}
gss_snap_insta <- gss %>%
  # create the new variable for snap_insta
  mutate(snap_insta = case_when(
    snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes", 
    snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No" ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_)) 
  
# calculate the proportion
gss_prop <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  filter(!is.na(snap_insta)) %>% 
  group_by(snap_insta) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = count/sum(count)) 

gss_prop

# percentile_ci
snap_insta_formula_ci <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  # using the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(p_hat = prop(snap_insta == "Yes"),
            count = n(),
            se = sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical*se,
            lower_95 = p_hat - margin_of_error,
            upper_95 = p_hat + margin_of_error)

snap_insta_formula_ci

# additional plot for practice -> check the way that he did it in a previous example ?
histogram_si <- ggplot(snap_insta_formula_ci,  
       aes(x = sex,
           y = p_hat,
           colour = sex)) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95,
                     ymax = upper_95),
                     width = 0.05,
                     size  = 0.5) +
   geom_point(shape = 15,
              size  = 4) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1)) +
   theme_bw() +
   theme(axis.title   = element_text(face  = "bold")) +
   labs(x = "Gender",
     y = "",
   title = "Women are more likely than men to use Snapchat or Instagram in 2016") +
   theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
   NULL

histogram_si

```


## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascending order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

```{r}
# turn degree from a character variable into a factor variable 
gss_factor <- gss %>%
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, order = TRUE, levels = c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate")))

# create the new variable bachelor_graduate and assign values based on criteria below:
gss_degree <- gss_factor %>%
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree %in% c("Bachelor","Master") ~ "Yes", 
    degree %in% c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college") ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ "NA"
    )) 

# filter out NAs and filter for bachelor and graduates
gss_bachelor <- gss_degree %>%
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes")


# calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` using twitter -> check error -> actually use " formula for difference in proportion"
gss_twitter_prop <- gss_bachelor %>%
  group_by(twitter) %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop_t = n/sum(n))
  

gss_twitter_prop

# construct CI for `bachelor_graduate` (not) using twitter (but with the NAs in the 100 % )
twitter_formula_ci <- gss_twitter_prop %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>%
   # use the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(twitter = twitter,
            p_hat_t = prop_t,
            # se for difference in proportions is sqrt(((p(1-p))/n) + ((p(1-p))/n))
            se_t = sqrt((p_hat_t *(1-p_hat_t))/n),
            count_t = n,
            t_critical_t = qt(0.975, count_t-1),
            margin_of_error_t = t_critical_t*se_t,
            lower_95_t = p_hat_t - margin_of_error_t,
            upper_95_t = p_hat_t + margin_of_error_t)

twitter_formula_ci
  
# check if Confidence Intervals overlap
histogram_t <- ggplot(twitter_formula_ci,  
       aes(x = twitter,
           y = p_hat_t,
           colour = twitter)) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95_t,
                     ymax = upper_95_t),
                     width = 0.05,
                     size  = 0.5) +
   geom_point(shape = 15,
              size  = 4) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1)) +
   theme_bw() +
   theme(axis.title   = element_text(face  = "bold")) +
   labs(x = "Twitter usage",
        y = "",
   title = "Twitter usage among people with a bachelor or graduate degree in 2016") +
   theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
   NULL

histogram_t

```


## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

```{r}
as.numeric(gss$emailhr)

```

# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.



You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)

```

```{r trump_margins, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
net_approval_plot <- approval_polllist %>%
  filter(subgroup == "Voters") %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(enddate),
         year = year(date),
         week = week(date
        )) %>%
  group_by(year, week) %>%
  summarise(avg_net_approval = mean(adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove),
            sd_net_approval = sd(adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove),
            count = n(),
            #get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            se_net_approval = sd_net_approval / sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_net_approval,
            net_approval_low = avg_net_approval - margin_of_error,
            net_approval_high = avg_net_approval + margin_of_error) %>%
  ggplot(aes(week, avg_net_approval)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(
    ymin = net_approval_low, 
    ymax = net_approval_high), 
    alpha = 0.4
    ) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), color = "orange") +
  labs(
    title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve - disapprove) for Donald Trump",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
    x = "week of the year",
    y = "Average Net Apporval (%)"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  coord_cartesian(
    xlim = c(0, 52), 
    ylim = c(-20, 10
  )) +
  theme_bw()

net_approval_plot
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

>Answer

- The confidence interval for 'week 15' is [-9.93, -6.197], and for 'week 34' it is a wider [-12.26, -7.553], indicating that the deviation of Trump's polls became larger from April to August. This may be related to the mixed reviews he received in the handling of domestic issues, such as COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter.

# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

```{r}
#pivot longer the 2nd to 34th columns of estumated numbers of people living with HIV into one column
hiv_long <- hiv %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=2:34, 
               names_to="year", 
               values_to = "estimated_hiv")
hiv_long

#pivot longer the 2nd to 302nd columns of life expectancy in countries to one column

# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()


```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)

options(scipen=999)

covid_co_morbidities <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(medcond_yn == "Yes" | medcond_yn == "No", #filter out unknown and missing
         sex == "Male" | sex == "Female", # filter out other, unknown and missing. Other is always zero.
         age_group != "Unknown",
         age_group != "NA"
         ) %>% 
  group_by(medcond_yn, age_group, sex) %>% 
  summarise(death_rate = count(death_yn == "Yes")/n()*100)

covid_ICU <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(icu_yn == "Yes" | icu_yn == "No", #filter out unknown and missing
         sex == "Male" | sex == "Female", # filter out other, unknown and missing. Other is always zero.
         age_group != "Unknown",
         age_group != "NA"
         ) %>% 
  group_by(icu_yn, age_group, sex) %>% 
  summarise(death_rate = count(death_yn == "Yes")/n()*100)

covid_co_morbidities %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = age_group,
    y = death_rate,
    fill=sex,
    label = round(death_rate, digits = 1)
  )) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position=position_dodge()) +
  geom_text() +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_grid(vars(medcond_yn), vars(sex))

covid_ICU %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = age_group,
    y = death_rate,
    fill=sex,
    label = round(death_rate, digits = 1)
  )) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position=position_dodge()) +
  geom_text() +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_grid(vars(icu_yn), vars(sex))
  
  

```


Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!


# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.

# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.
```{r}
glimpse(weather)
```

    cols = -Year
  )
tidyweather

```{r tidyweather}
weather_select <- weather %>% 
  select(Year:Dec)

tidyweather <- weather_select %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "Month",
    values_to = "delta",


```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

tidyweather_plot <- ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

tidyweather_plot +
  facet_wrap(~month)

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values
  filter(na.rm = TRUE)

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_line(method = loess) +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}
library(infer)
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta)
  specify(response = delta) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type ="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") #%>% 
   #%>% 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  #summarise(
    #mean = mean(delta),
    #SD = sd(delta),
    #count = n()
 # )

  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  
#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
formula_ci %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
  
```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r}
gss_snap_insta <- gss %>%
  # create the new variable for snap_insta
  mutate(snap_insta = case_when(
    snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes", 
    snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No" ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_)) 
  
# calculate the proportion
gss_prop <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  filter(!is.na(snap_insta)) %>% 
  group_by(snap_insta) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = count/sum(count)) 

gss_prop

# percentile_ci
snap_insta_formula_ci <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  # using the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(p_hat = prop(snap_insta == "Yes"),
            count = n(),
            se = sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical*se,
            lower_95 = p_hat - margin_of_error,
            upper_95 = p_hat + margin_of_error)

snap_insta_formula_ci

# additional plot for practice -> check the way that he did it in a previous example ?
histogram_si <- ggplot(snap_insta_formula_ci,

## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascending order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

```{r}

# turn degree from a character variable into a factor variable 
gss_factor <- gss %>%
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, order = TRUE, levels = c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate")))

# create the new variable bachelor_graduate and assign values based on criteria below:
gss_degree <- gss_factor %>%
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree %in% c("Bachelor","Master") ~ "Yes", 
    degree %in% c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college") ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ "NA"
    )) 

# filter out NAs and filter for bachelor and graduates
gss_bachelor <- gss_degree %>%
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes")


# calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` using twitter -> check error -> actually use " formula for difference in proportion"
gss_twitter_prop <- gss_bachelor %>%
  group_by(twitter) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop_t = n/sum(n)) %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA")

gss_twitter_prop

# construct CI for `bachelor_graduate` (not) using twitter (but with the NAs in the 100 % )
twitter_formula_ci <- gss_twitter_prop %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>%
   # use the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(twitter = twitter,
            p_hat_t = prop_t,
            # se for difference in proportions is sqrt(((p(1-p))/n) + ((p(1-p))/n))
            se_t = sqrt(sum((p_hat_t *(1-p_hat_t))/n)),
            count_t = n,
            t_critical_t = qt(0.975, count_t-1),
            margin_of_error_t = t_critical_t*se_t,
            lower_95_t = p_hat_t - margin_of_error_t,
            upper_95_t = p_hat_t + margin_of_error_t)

twitter_formula_ci
  
# check if Confidence Intervals overlap
histogram_t <- ggplot(twitter_formula_ci,  
       aes(x = twitter,
           y = p_hat_t,
           colour = twitter)) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95_t,
                     ymax = upper_95_t),
                     width = 0.05,
                     size  = 0.5) +
   geom_point(shape = 15,
              size  = 4) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1)) +
   theme_bw() +
   theme(axis.title   = element_text(face  = "bold")) +

   theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
   NULL

histogram_t


```


## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

```{r}
# create new variable email
gss_email <- gss %>% 
  filter(emailmin != "NA", emailhr != "NA") %>%
  mutate(emailmin = as.numeric(emailmin), emailhr = as.numeric(emailhr)) %>%
  mutate(email = emailhr*60 + emailmin)

# visualise the distribution
plot_email <- ggplot(gss_email, 
  aes(x = email)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(email, na.rm = T)),   # Ignore NA values for mean
               color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(email, na.rm = T)),   # Ignore NA values for mean
               color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
  annotate("text", x = 800, y = 0.0025, label = "mean", color="red") +
  annotate("text", x = 500, y = 0.00261, label = "median", color="blue") +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Right-skewed distribution of time spent on emails by US adults",
       x = "Minutes spent on emails per week",
       y = " ")+
  NULL

plot_email

# calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean
boot_email <- gss_email %>% 
  specify(response = email) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") 
  
boot_email

# 95% CI and humanize units
percentile_ci <- boot_email %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile") %>%
  mutate(lower_ci_hum = lower_ci %/% 60 + (lower_ci %% 60)/100, upper_ci_hum = upper_ci %/% 60 + (upper_ci %% 60)/100)

percentile_ci

```
### Comparison to a 99% confidence interval
A 99% confidence interval would be wider than a 95% confidence interval since you have to be more confident that the true value (in the case email minutes) falls within the interval we will need to allow more potential values within the interval. The confidence level most commonly adopted is 95%.

# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.



You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.


# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful
1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful
1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.
1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.
1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?


# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()


```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)
```


Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!


# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.

# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.
```{r}
glimpse(weather)
```

    cols = -Year
  )
tidyweather

```{r tidyweather}
weather_select <- weather %>% 
  select(Year:Dec)

tidyweather <- weather_select %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "Month",
    values_to = "delta",


```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

tidyweather_plot <- ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

tidyweather_plot +
  facet_wrap(~month)

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values
  filter(na.rm = TRUE)

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_line(method = loess) +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}
library(infer)
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta)
  specify(response = delta) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type ="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") #%>% 
   #%>% 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  #summarise(
    #mean = mean(delta),
    #SD = sd(delta),
    #count = n()
 # )

  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  
#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
formula_ci %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
  
```

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r}
# I'm working on this - Josi
gss %>% 
  mutate(snap_insta = case_when(
    snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes",
    snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No" ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ "NA"
  ))


```


## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascending order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

```{r}

gss %>% 
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree == "Bachelor" | degree == "Graduate" ~ "Yes",
    degree == "NA" ~ "NA",
    TRUE ~ "No"
)) %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes") %>% 
  select(twitter)


```


## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

```{r}
as.numeric(gss$emailhr)

```

# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.



You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r trump_margins}
net_approval_plot <- approval_polllist %>%
  filter(subgroup == "Voters") %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(enddate),
         year = year(date),
         week = week(date)) %>%
  group_by(year, week) %>%
  summarise(avg_net_approval = mean(adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove),
            sd_net_approval = sd(adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove),
            count = n(),
            #get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            se_net_approval = sd_net_approval / sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_net_approval,
            net_approval_low = avg_net_approval - margin_of_error,
            net_approval_high = avg_net_approval + margin_of_error) %>%
  ggplot(aes(week, avg_net_approval)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = net_approval_low, ymax = net_approval_high), alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), color = "orange") +
  labs(
    title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve - disapprove) for Donald Trump",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
    x = "week of the year",
    y = "Average Net Apporval (%)"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~year)

net_approval_plot
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

>Answer

- The confidence interval for 'week 15' is [-9.93, -6.197], and for 'week 34' it is a wider [-12.26, -7.553], indicating that the deviation of Trump's polls became larger from April to August. This may be ralated to the mixed reviews he received in the handling of domestic issues, such as COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter.

# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful
1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful
1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.
1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.
1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?


# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()




```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)

glimpse(covid_data)

options(scipen=999)

covid_co_morbidities <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(medcond_yn == "Yes" | medcond_yn == "No",
         sex == "Male" | sex == "Female", # filter out other, unknown and missing. Other is always zero.
         age_group != "Unknown",
         age_group != "NA"
         ) %>% 
  group_by(medcond_yn, age_group, sex) %>% 
  summarise(death_rate = count(death_yn == "Yes")/n())

covid_co_morbidities %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = age_group,
    y = death_rate,
    fill=sex,
    fill = medcond_yn
  )) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.7, position=position_dodge(width=0.8)) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ medcond_yn)

  

```


Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!


# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.

# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.
```{r}
glimpse(weather)
```



```{r tidyweather}
weather_select <- weather %>% 
  select(Year:Dec)

tidyweather <- weather_select %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "Month",
    values_to = "delta",
    cols = -Year
  )
tidyweather

```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

tidyweather_plot <- ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

tidyweather_plot +
  facet_wrap(~month)

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values
  filter(na.rm = TRUE)

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_line(method = loess) +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}

library(infer)

average_annual_anomaly

comparison_filter <- drop_na(average_annual_anomaly) %>%
  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(Year > 2011)
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
comparison_formula_ci <- comparison_filter %>% 
  
  summarize(mean = mean(annual_average_delta), sd = sd(annual_average_delta), n = n()) %>%

  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  mutate(se = sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  mutate(lower_95 = mean - 2*se, upper_95 = mean + 2*se)

#print out formula_CI
comparison_formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
bootstrap_comparison <- comparison_filter %>% 
specify(response = annual_average_delta) %>% 
generate(reps = 1000) %>% 
calculate(stat = "mean")

comparison_ci <-bootstrap_comparison %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

comparison_ci

distribution <- bootstrap_comparison %>% 
  visualise() + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = comparison_ci )

distribution

  
```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

We are 95% confident that the average annual temperature deviation since 2011 is between 0.886 and 1.13. 

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r}
gss_snap_insta <- gss %>%
  # create the new variable for snap_insta
  mutate(snap_insta = case_when(
    snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes", 
    snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No" ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_)) 
  
# calculate the proportion
gss_prop <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  filter(!is.na(snap_insta)) %>% 
  group_by(snap_insta) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = count/sum(count)) 

gss_prop

# percentile_ci
snap_insta_formula_ci <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  # using the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(p_hat = prop(snap_insta == "Yes"),
            count = n(),
            se = sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical*se,
            lower_95 = p_hat - margin_of_error,
            upper_95 = p_hat + margin_of_error)

snap_insta_formula_ci

# additional plot for practice -> check the way that he did it in a previous example ?
histogram_si <- ggplot(snap_insta_formula_ci,  
       aes(x = sex,
           y = p_hat,
           colour = sex)) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95,
                     ymax = upper_95),
                     width = 0.05,
                     size  = 0.5) +
   geom_point(shape = 15,
              size  = 4) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1)) +
   theme_bw() +
   theme(axis.title   = element_text(face  = "bold")) +
   labs(x = "Gender",
     y = "",
   title = "Women are more likely than men to use Snapchat or Instagram in 2016") +
   theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
   NULL

histogram_si

```


## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascending order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

```{r}
# turn degree from a character variable into a factor variable 
gss_factor <- gss %>%
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, order = TRUE, levels = c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate")))

# create the new variable bachelor_graduate and assign values based on criteria below:
gss_degree <- gss_factor %>%
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree %in% c("Bachelor","Master") ~ "Yes", 
    degree %in% c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college") ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ "NA"
    )) 

# filter out NAs and filter for bachelor and graduates
gss_bachelor <- gss_degree %>%
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes")


# calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` using twitter -> check error -> actually use " formula for difference in proportion"
gss_twitter_prop <- gss_bachelor %>%
  group_by(twitter) %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop_t = n/sum(n))
  

gss_twitter_prop

# construct CI for `bachelor_graduate` (not) using twitter (but with the NAs in the 100 % )
twitter_formula_ci <- gss_twitter_prop %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>%
   # use the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(twitter = twitter,
            p_hat_t = prop_t,
            # se for difference in proportions is sqrt(((p(1-p))/n) + ((p(1-p))/n))
            se_t = sqrt((p_hat_t *(1-p_hat_t))/n),
            count_t = n,
            t_critical_t = qt(0.975, count_t-1),
            margin_of_error_t = t_critical_t*se_t,
            lower_95_t = p_hat_t - margin_of_error_t,
            upper_95_t = p_hat_t + margin_of_error_t)

twitter_formula_ci
  
# check if Confidence Intervals overlap
histogram_t <- ggplot(twitter_formula_ci,  
       aes(x = twitter,
           y = p_hat_t,
           colour = twitter)) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95_t,
                     ymax = upper_95_t),
                     width = 0.05,
                     size  = 0.5) +
   geom_point(shape = 15,
              size  = 4) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1)) +
   theme_bw() +
   theme(axis.title   = element_text(face  = "bold")) +
   labs(x = "Twitter usage",
        y = "",
   title = "Twitter usage among people with a bachelor or graduate degree in 2016") +
   theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
   NULL

histogram_t

```


## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

```{r}
as.numeric(gss$emailhr)

```

# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.



You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)

```

```{r trump_margins, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
net_approval_plot <- approval_polllist %>%
  filter(subgroup == "Voters") %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(enddate),
         year = year(date),
         week = week(date
        )) %>%
  group_by(year, week) %>%
  summarise(avg_net_approval = mean(adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove),
            sd_net_approval = sd(adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove),
            count = n(),
            #get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            se_net_approval = sd_net_approval / sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_net_approval,
            net_approval_low = avg_net_approval - margin_of_error,
            net_approval_high = avg_net_approval + margin_of_error) %>%
  ggplot(aes(week, avg_net_approval)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(
    ymin = net_approval_low, 
    ymax = net_approval_high), 
    alpha = 0.4
    ) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), color = "orange") +
  labs(
    title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve - disapprove) for Donald Trump",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
    x = "week of the year",
    y = "Average Net Apporval (%)"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  coord_cartesian(
    xlim = c(0, 52), 
    ylim = c(-20, 10
  )) +
  theme_bw()

net_approval_plot
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

>Answer

- The confidence interval for 'week 15' is [-9.93, -6.197], and for 'week 34' it is a wider [-12.26, -7.553], indicating that the deviation of Trump's polls became larger from April to August. This may be related to the mixed reviews he received in the handling of domestic issues, such as COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter.

# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

```{r}
#pivot longer the 2nd to 34th columns of estumated numbers of people living with HIV into one column
hiv_long <- hiv %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=2:34, 
               names_to="year", 
               values_to = "estimated_hiv")
hiv_long

#pivot longer the 2nd to 302nd columns of life expectancy in countries to one column
life_expectancy_long <- life_expectancy %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:302, 
               names_to="year", 
               values_to = "life_expec")

#rename columns in worldban_data
names(worldbank_data)[5] <- "gdpPercap"
names(worldbank_data)[6] <- "female_fertility"
names(worldbank_data)[7] <- "elementary_enrolment"
names(worldbank_data)[8] <- "mortality_rate"
worldbank_data$date <- as.character(worldbank_data$date)

#merge life expectancy and expected numbers of hiv patient into lifeExp_hiv
lifeExp_hiv <- left_join(hiv_long, life_expectancy_long, by = c("year", "country"))

#merge worldbank data and lifeExp_hiv into lifeExp_hiv_wb
lifeExp_hiv_wb <- left_join(lifeExp_hiv, worldbank_data, 
                                 by = c("year"="date","country"))

#merge country data into a complete dataframe
complete_data <- full_join(lifeExp_hiv_wb,countries,by = "country")
complete_data

```


1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful

```{r}
complete_data_filtered <- complete_data %>% drop_na()
ggplot(complete_data_filtered) +
geom_point(aes(
  x=estimated_hiv, 
  y=life_expec,
  colour = region
)) +
geom_smooth(aes(x=estimated_hiv, y=life_expec), se = FALSE)+
NULL

ggplot(complete_data_filtered) +
geom_point(aes(
  x=estimated_hiv, 
  y=life_expec,
)) +
geom_smooth(aes(x=estimated_hiv, y=life_expec), se = FALSE)+
facet_wrap(~region, scales = "free")+
NULL


```

Answer:
In general, HIV prevelance seems to have a negative relationship with life expectancy. If we look at the relationship by region, the negative correlation is most obvious in Latin America and Carribean and Sub-Saharan Africa, while in the other 4 regions HIV prevelance do not have a clear linear relationship with life expectancy.

1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful

```{r}

ggplot(complete_data_filtered) +
geom_point(aes(
  x = female_fertility, 
  y = gdpPercap
)) +
geom_smooth(aes(
  x = female_fertility, 
  y = gdpPercap)) +
facet_wrap(~region, scales = "free") +
NULL
```


Answer:
In general, fertality is positively related to GDP per capita. This positive relationship is most obvious in Latin America and Carribean and Middle East & North Africa.

1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.

```{r}

missing_HIV_regions <- complete_data %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarise(missing_HIV_data = count(is.na(estimated_hiv))) %>% 
  filter(region != "NA")

missing_HIV_regions %>% 
ggplot(aes(
  x = reorder(region, missing_HIV_data),
  y = missing_HIV_data
)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  NULL
  

```

Answer: 
Sub-Saharan Africa has the most missing HIV data. Europe & Central Asia has the second most missing HIV data. 

1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.

```{r}
mortality <- complete_data %>%
  select(1,2,10,18)%>%
  drop_na() 

ggplot(mortality) +
geom_point(aes(
  x=year, 
  y=mortality_rate,
  color=country
)) +
geom_smooth(aes(x=year, y=mortality_rate), se = FALSE)+
facet_wrap(~region, scales = "free") +
theme(legend.position = "none")+
NULL

mortality %>%
  mutate(delta=)



```


1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?

```{r}

ggplot(complete_data_filtered) +
geom_point(aes(x=female_fertility, y=elementary_enrolment)) +
geom_smooth(aes(x=female_fertility, y=elementary_enrolment), se = FALSE)+
facet_wrap(~region, scales = "free") +
NULL

```


Answer:
Across all six regions, primary school enrollment is negatively related with fertility rate. It seems intuitive, as when a family has more children, it adds on more financial stress to the parents to put all the children through education, therefore the primary school enrollment rate is lower.

# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()


```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)

options(scipen=999)

covid_co_morbidities <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(medcond_yn == "Yes" | medcond_yn == "No", #filter out unknown and missing
         sex == "Male" | sex == "Female", # filter out other, unknown and missing. Other is always zero.
         age_group != "Unknown",
         age_group != "NA"
         ) %>% 
  group_by(medcond_yn, age_group, sex) %>% 
  summarise(death_rate = count(death_yn == "Yes")/n()*100)

covid_ICU <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(icu_yn == "Yes" | icu_yn == "No", #filter out unknown and missing
         sex == "Male" | sex == "Female", # filter out other, unknown and missing. Other is always zero.
         age_group != "Unknown",
         age_group != "NA"
         ) %>% 
  group_by(icu_yn, age_group, sex) %>% 
  summarise(death_rate = count(death_yn == "Yes")/n()*100)

covid_co_morbidities %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = age_group,
    y = death_rate,
    fill=sex,
    label = round(death_rate, digits = 1)
  )) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position=position_dodge()) +
  geom_text() +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_grid(vars(medcond_yn), vars(sex))

covid_ICU %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = age_group,
    y = death_rate,
    fill=sex,
    label = round(death_rate, digits = 1)
  )) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position=position_dodge()) +
  geom_text() +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_grid(vars(icu_yn), vars(sex))
  
  

```


Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!


# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.

# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.
```{r}
glimpse(weather)
```

    cols = -Year
  )
tidyweather

```{r tidyweather}
weather_select <- weather %>% 
  select(Year:Dec)

tidyweather <- weather_select %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "Month",
    values_to = "delta",


```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

tidyweather_plot <- ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

tidyweather_plot +
  facet_wrap(~month)

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values
  filter(na.rm = TRUE)

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_line(method = loess) +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}
library(infer)
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta)
  specify(response = delta) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type ="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") #%>% 
   #%>% 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  #summarise(
    #mean = mean(delta),
    #SD = sd(delta),
    #count = n()
 # )

  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  
#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
formula_ci %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
  
```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r}
gss_snap_insta <- gss %>%
  # create the new variable for snap_insta
  mutate(snap_insta = case_when(
    snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes", 
    snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No" ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_)) 
  
# calculate the proportion
gss_prop <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  filter(!is.na(snap_insta)) %>% 
  group_by(snap_insta) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = count/sum(count)) 

gss_prop

# percentile_ci
snap_insta_formula_ci <- gss_snap_insta %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  # using the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(p_hat = prop(snap_insta == "Yes"),
            count = n(),
            se = sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical*se,
            lower_95 = p_hat - margin_of_error,
            upper_95 = p_hat + margin_of_error)

snap_insta_formula_ci

# additional plot for practice -> check the way that he did it in a previous example ?
histogram_si <- ggplot(snap_insta_formula_ci,  
       aes(x = sex,
           y = p_hat,
           colour = sex)) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95,
                     ymax = upper_95),
                     width = 0.05,
                     size  = 0.5) +
   geom_point(shape = 15,
              size  = 4) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1)) +
   theme_bw() +
   theme(axis.title   = element_text(face  = "bold")) +
   labs(x = "Gender",
     y = "",
   title = "Women are more likely than men to use Snapchat or Instagram in 2016") +
   theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
   NULL

histogram_si


```


## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascending order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

```{r}

# turn degree from a character variable into a factor variable 
gss_factor <- gss %>%
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, order = TRUE, levels = c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate")))

# create the new variable bachelor_graduate and assign values based on criteria below:
gss_degree <- gss_factor %>%
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree %in% c("Bachelor","Master") ~ "Yes", 
    degree %in% c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college") ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ "NA"
    )) 

# filter out NAs and filter for bachelor and graduates
gss_bachelor <- gss_degree %>%
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes")


# calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` using twitter -> check error -> actually use " formula for difference in proportion"
gss_twitter_prop <- gss_bachelor %>%
  group_by(twitter) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop_t = n/sum(n)) %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA")

gss_twitter_prop

# construct CI for `bachelor_graduate` (not) using twitter (but with the NAs in the 100 % )
twitter_formula_ci <- gss_twitter_prop %>%
  filter(twitter != "NA") %>%
   # use the CI formula m +- z * se
  summarize(twitter = twitter,
            p_hat_t = prop_t,
            # se for difference in proportions is sqrt(((p(1-p))/n) + ((p(1-p))/n))
            se_t = sqrt(sum((p_hat_t *(1-p_hat_t))/n)),
            count_t = n,
            t_critical_t = qt(0.975, count_t-1),
            margin_of_error_t = t_critical_t*se_t,
            lower_95_t = p_hat_t - margin_of_error_t,
            upper_95_t = p_hat_t + margin_of_error_t)

twitter_formula_ci
  
# check if Confidence Intervals overlap
histogram_t <- ggplot(twitter_formula_ci,  
       aes(x = twitter,
           y = p_hat_t,
           colour = twitter)) +
   geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_95_t,

## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

```{r}
# create new variable email
gss_email <- gss %>% 
  filter(emailmin != "NA", emailhr != "NA") %>%
  mutate(emailmin = as.numeric(emailmin), emailhr = as.numeric(emailhr)) %>%
  mutate(email = emailhr*60 + emailmin)

# visualise the distribution
plot_email <- ggplot(gss_email, 
  aes(x = email)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(email, na.rm = T)),   # Ignore NA values for mean
               color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(email, na.rm = T)),   # Ignore NA values for mean
               color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
  annotate("text", x = 800, y = 0.0025, label = "mean", color="red") +
  annotate("text", x = 500, y = 0.00261, label = "median", color="blue") +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Right-skewed distribution of time spent on emails by US adults",
       x = "Minutes spent on emails per week",
       y = " ")+
  NULL

plot_email

# calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean
boot_email <- gss_email %>% 
  specify(response = email) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") 
  
boot_email

# 95% CI and humanize units
percentile_ci <- boot_email %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile") %>%
  mutate(lower_ci_hum = lower_ci %/% 60 + (lower_ci %% 60)/100, upper_ci_hum = upper_ci %/% 60 + (upper_ci %% 60)/100)

percentile_ci

```
### Comparison to a 99% confidence interval
A 99% confidence interval would be wider than a 95% confidence interval since you have to be more confident that the true value (in the case email minutes) falls within the interval we will need to allow more potential values within the interval. The confidence level most commonly adopted is 95%.

# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.



You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.


# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful
1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful
1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.
1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.
1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?


# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()


```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)
```


Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!


# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.

# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.
```{r}
glimpse(weather)
```

    cols = -Year
  )
tidyweather

```{r tidyweather}
weather_select <- weather %>% 
  select(Year:Dec)

tidyweather <- weather_select %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "Month",
    values_to = "delta",


```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

tidyweather_plot <- ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

tidyweather_plot +
  facet_wrap(~month)

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculaltes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values
  filter(na.rm = TRUE)

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_line(method = loess) +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}
library(infer)
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta)
  specify(response = delta) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type ="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") #%>% 
   #%>% 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  #summarise(
    #mean = mean(delta),
    #SD = sd(delta),
    #count = n()
 # )

  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  
#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
formula_ci %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
  
```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r}
# I'm working on this - Josi
gss %>% 
  mutate(snap_insta = case_when(
    snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes" ~ "Yes",
    snapchat == "No" & instagrm == "No" ~ "No",
    TRUE ~ "NA"
  ))


```


## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascending order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

```{r}

gss %>% 
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = case_when(
    degree == "Bachelor" | degree == "Graduate" ~ "Yes",
    degree == "NA" ~ "NA",
    TRUE ~ "No"
)) %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes") %>% 
  select(twitter)


```


## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

```{r}
as.numeric(gss$emailhr)

```

# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.



You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r trump_margins}
net_approval_plot <- approval_polllist %>%
  filter(subgroup == "Voters") %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(enddate),
         year = year(date),
         week = week(date)) %>%
  group_by(year, week) %>%
  summarise(avg_net_approval = mean(adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove),
            sd_net_approval = sd(adjusted_approve - adjusted_disapprove),
            count = n(),
            #get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            se_net_approval = sd_net_approval / sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_net_approval,
            net_approval_low = avg_net_approval - margin_of_error,
            net_approval_high = avg_net_approval + margin_of_error) %>%
  ggplot(aes(week, avg_net_approval)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = net_approval_low, ymax = net_approval_high), alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), color = "orange") +
  labs(
    title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve - disapprove) for Donald Trump",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
    x = "week of the year",
    y = "Average Net Apporval (%)"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~year)

net_approval_plot
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

>Answer

- The confidence interval for 'week 15' is [-9.93, -6.197], and for 'week 34' it is a wider [-12.26, -7.553], indicating that the deviation of Trump's polls became larger from April to August. This may be ralated to the mixed reviews he received in the handling of domestic issues, such as COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter.

# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful
1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful
1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.
1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.
1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?


# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()




```

Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)

glimpse(covid_data)

options(scipen=999)

covid_co_morbidities <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(medcond_yn == "Yes" | medcond_yn == "No",
         sex == "Male" | sex == "Female", # filter out other, unknown and missing. Other is always zero.
         age_group != "Unknown",
         age_group != "NA"
         ) %>% 
  group_by(medcond_yn, age_group, sex) %>% 
  summarise(death_rate = count(death_yn == "Yes")/n())

covid_co_morbidities %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = age_group,
    y = death_rate,
    fill=sex,
    fill = medcond_yn
  )) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.7, position=position_dodge(width=0.8)) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap(~ medcond_yn)

  

```


Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!


# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
